          <h1>Contributions</h1>
          	<p>The calculation of offset in current NTP is based on the premise that the outgoing transit time and the incoming transit time are the same. Outgoing transit time adds to the measured offset, whereas incoming transit time subtracts from the measured offset. This offset is erroneously calculated due to the difference between the outgoing and incoming transit times.
Instead we calculate the offset using the outgoing transit time with the aid of network infrastructure thus eliminating the error by not relying on the above premise.</p>
          <h1>Definitions</h1>
          <ul>
			<li>The remote node is defined as the node whose clock is considered as reference clock and keeps true time.</li>
			<li>The offset is defined as the difference between the remote clock time and the local clock time.</li>
			<li>Incoming transit time refers to the time taken by a request from local to remote server.</li>
			<li>Outgoing transit time refers to the time taken by a request from remote to local server.</li>
			<li>Time Source or reference clock is the clock with which every other node synchronizes its own clock.</li>
			<li>CNTP is the custom NTP introduced in this paper.</li>
			<li>DRTT is defined as a direct round trip delay between two connected nodes.</li>
			<li>End to end transit time is defined as the time taken for packet to travel from one node to another across the network.</li>
			<li>Send Timestamp is the timestamp established by the client host and specifying the local time at which the request departed for the service host.</li>
		    </ul>
		  <h1>Our Approach &nbsp;- &nbsp;<span>Details</span></h1>
		  	<p>In this section we explain the working of custom network 
		  	   and custom protocols that comprise of our proposed solution.
		  	</p>
		  	<p>
		  		<h3><span>Kernel Timestamping</span></h3>
		  		<p>When timestamping is done at application layer, the difference between 
		  			timestamp and the time when the packet is sent on the line is non-deterministic 
		  			in nature due to queuing and processing delay in kernel as well as hardware. 
		  			Our approach would be to timestamp as close as possible to the physical layer to minimize the non deterministic delays.
				</p>
		  	</p>
		  	<p>
		  		<h3><span>Custom Network Protocol</span></h3>
		  		<p>To reduce the processing overhead introduced by standard TCP / IP 
		  		protocol suite, we use custom network protocol. This would help us in bypassing 
		  		the TCP / IP stack and save on processing power and memory used when sending 
		  		packets over the network.

				<br/>
				<br/>
		  		The total length of the custom packet header is 64 bits and its fields are:
		  			<ol type = 'a'>
		  				<li><b>Next Hop Address:</b> This is a 16 bit field and is analogous to 
		  					destination MAC address in TCP / IP.</li>
		  				<li><b>Destination Address:</b> This is a 16 bit field and is analogous to 
		  					destination IP address in TCP/ IP.</li>
		  				<li><b>Source Address:</b> This is a 16 bit field and is analogous to source 
		  					IP address in TCP / IP.</li>
		  				<li><b>Destination Port:</b> This is a 16 bit field and is analogous to 
		  					 destination port number in TCP / IP</li>
		  			</ol>
		  		</p>
		  	</p>
			<p>
		  		<h3><span>Direct Round Trip Time Daemon (DRTT)</span></h3>
		  		<p>To calculate end to end transit time, we need to know the delay between
		  		   directly connected nodes along the path. To determine this delay, an 
		  		   independent DRTT daemon runs on every node of the network both as client and server.
		  		   <br/>

						<br/>
		  		   <ol type = 'a'>
		  		   <li><b>DRTT Packet Structure:</b> <p>
						
		  		   		  The total length of the DRTT packet is 128 bits. First 64 bits 
		  		   		  are the custom packet header. The next 64 bits contains the send timestamp. It 
		  		   		  will always have a nonzero value.</p></li>
		  		    <li><b>DRTT Request Packet:</b> 
		  		           DRTT packet sent by DRTT client to DRTT server.</li>
					<li><b>DRTT Reply Packet:</b>
						   An echo reply from DRTT server in response to a DRTT request.</li>
					<li><b>DRTT Daemon as Client:</b>
						The DRTT daemon will periodically broadcast DRTT requests on all interfaces. We calculate 
						the DRTT by taking the difference between send timestamp from DRTT echo reply and the timestamp 
						when the reply is received. Repeated iterations of this procedure allow the local client to 
						remove the effects of network jitter by applying a filtering algorithm and thereby gain a 
						set of stable DRTT values. We use the average of DRTT values from this set as the best estimate.</li>
					<li><b>DRTT Daemon as Server:</b>
						The DRTT Daemon would send a unicast reply to the client for every DRTT request received.</li>

		  		<h3><span>Custom Network Time Protocol (CNTP)</span></h3>
		  		
		  		<p>In the following text we explain in detail the custom network time protocol
		  		   and its working to calculate the offset value between local and remote 
		  		   clocks. To determine this offset, CNTP service runs on remote and local nodes.</p>

						<br/>
						<br/>
						  <p class = "padleft">The CNTP packet uses the custom network 
		  		   		  protocol.The payload field contains the DRTT, receive and send
						  timestamp at each hop. Each time stamp is a 64 bit value, first 
						  32 bits denotes the epoch and next 32 bits denote the fraction of the second.</p>

						  <br/>
						  <br/>
						  <p class = "padleft">The problem with the traditional NTP is that it 
		  		          does not account for the asymmetric delay between remote and local. 
		  		          This is because local has no information to calculate the actual 
		  		          outgoing and incoming transit time of the system. Our approach is 
		  		          to measure the one way transit time from remote to local. We need
		  		          assistance from the routers/switches running DRTT daemon in the 
		  		          path in order to do so. If we know this transit time then we can 
		  		          calculate the correct offset.The CNTP server S<sub>0</sub> sends packet to 
		  		          the subscribed client S<sub>1</sub>, whose clock needs to be synchronized. 
		  		          The send timestamp, and DRTT of the next hop (R<sub>1</sub>) is appended to 
		  		          the payload.The intermediate router (R<sub>1</sub>) appends three values which are 
		  		          receive timestamp (T<sub>1</sub>), transmit timestamp (T<sub>2</sub>) and DRTT of the next hop (RTT<sub>1</sub>) 
		  		          respectively to the received packet before forwarding it. A timestamp T<sub>R</sub> is taken 
		  		          when client S<sub>1</sub> receives this packet. We calculate offset using these values 
		  		         
		  		          (&nbsp;T<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;,&nbsp;RTT<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;,&nbsp; T<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;,&nbsp; T<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;,&nbsp; RTT<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;,&nbsp; T<sub>R</sub>&nbsp;) in the formula mentioned below:
		  		           <br/>
		  		           <br/>
		  		          offset &nbsp;= &nbsp;T<sub>R</sub>&nbsp; - &nbsp;( &nbsp;T<sub>0</sub>&nbsp; + &nbsp;( &nbsp;RTT<sub>0</sub>&nbsp; / &nbsp;2 &nbsp;)&nbsp; +&nbsp; T<sub>2</sub>&nbsp; - &nbsp;T<sub>1</sub> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;(&nbsp; RTT<sub>1</sub>&nbsp; /&nbsp; 2 &nbsp;)&nbsp; )</p>

		  		   <p class = "thick">c.&nbsp;Validation:</p>
		  		   	<br/>
		  		   		<p class = "padleft">A.&nbsp;How to validate our implementation's accuracy?</p>
		  		   			<br/>
		  		   			<p class = "padleft2">The experiment would be demonstrated on deterlab. There is no 
		  		   		   		reference clock available on the local host (S<sub>1</sub>). To validate 
		  		   		   		the accuracy of proposed implementation, we consider the traditional
		  		   		  		 NTP to be accurate enough when operated over a direct link. 
		  		   		   		This implies the remote host (S<sub>0</sub>) and local host (S<sub>1</sub>) are connected 
		  		   		   		directly on a single link and the outgoing transit time TTX and incoming 
		  		   		   		transit time T<sub>RX</sub> are the same. Keeping S<sub>0</sub> and S<sub>1</sub> the same machines throughout 
		  		   		   		our experiment, the offset that we get for traditional NTP would be considered 
		  		   		   		our reference. Let us call this as offset<sub>reference</sub>. </p>

								<center><img  width="500" height="300"src="images/figure5.png" alt="figure5" align = "middle"/></center>
								
								<br/>
		  		   		   		
		  		   		    <p class = "padleft2">Next we prove that the traditional NTP would give us wrong offset 
		  		   		    	values compared to offsetreference when outgoing transit and incoming 
		  		   				transit time are not equal. For this we need to set up topology with 
		  		   				different outgoing and incoming transit times. Now we introduce a 
		  		   				router in the path from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub> as shown in the <span>Figure 6</span>. The router 
		  		   				introduces a delay of 500ms. With traditional NTP the offset calculated 
		  		   				will have an error as discussed in the contribution section to have error, 
		  		   				we call this as offseterror.Run the CNTP on the same test setup, 
		  		   				this would give us offset, let us call this offset<sub>CNTP</sub>. The closer 
		  		   				the offset<sub>CNTP</sub> is to that of offset<sub>reference</sub> the more accurate is our implementation.
