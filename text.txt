The local node is defined as the node which requests to synchronize with a reference clock.
￼				The remote node is defined as the node whose clock is considered as reference clock and keeps true time.
￼				The offset is defined as the difference between the remote clock time and the local clock time.
				Incoming transit time refers to the time taken by a request from local to remote server. 
				Outgoing transit time refers to the time taken by a request from remote to local server.
				Time source or reference clock is the clock with which every other node synchronizes its own clock.
				CNTP is the custom NTP introduced in this paper.
				DRTT is defined a direct round trip delay between two directly connect nodes.
				End to end transit time is defined as the time taken for packet to travel from one node to another across the network.
				Send timestamp is the timestamp established by the client host and specifying the local time at which the request departed for the service host.
